# Weight-Tracking-Mobile-App

**_Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?_**

The goals of this app were to help those working on their fitness journey who want to monitor their weight. This app provided a way for them to log their daily weights, set up goal weights and recieve notifications once they hit their goals. 

**_What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?_**

I needed one screen for the login screen where the user either signs in to their existing account or signs up for a new account. This included simple UI elements where the user can easily type in their username and password. The second screen was where the actual weights were shown. It would display the database of all logged weights and their dates. Then, the user could edit or delete any specific weights they wanted. The goal weight was displayed on this page as well. I tried to keep my designs simplistic and easy to understand so that anyone who picks up the app will know what they are doing regardless of how good they are with technology. 

**_How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?_**

The way I approached coding for this app was to look over the requirements of what was needed and then break down each component step by step to not get overwhelmed with everything. The UI was by far easier to set up because of this and while my code wasn't completed, it made it simpler to follow what I needed to do when I went through the requirements one at a time. This can be applied to the future because I'm sure I will face problems with coding where I need to be able to see what the issue is and work through how to solve it similarly as I did here. 

**_How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?_**

The code should have been tested by setting up a local mobile device to run the app on through the Android Studio Emulator. This process is important because it will reveal any bugs I might have missed in the code that end users would see. It gives me a chance to act as a user and try to predict what someone might do if they were using the app to see where it might break.

**_Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?_**

I had to innovate when it came to setting up the UI design. I thought it was going to be something that was extremely easy to do but setting up the table was actually giving me a lot of trouble. I ended up using a grid as a placeholder for all the weight inputs. 

**_In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?_**

I think I was most successful at setting up the UI elements. Android Studio made it very simple to set up a UI and trying to make sure it was functional and looked appealing was something I think I achieved. I do wish there were some changes I made in the end to make it look even better.
